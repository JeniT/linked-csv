These examples are from [Eurostat](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/themes). The XML files are tables that have been downloaded from the statistics portal, and the XSLT is a stylesheet to transform these into linked CSV files.

The linked CSV files themselves are in the subdirectories; each contains a set of linked CSV files and a packaged version of those files to illustrate how linked CSV packages work (they're just a zip of the linked CSV files within the folders).
