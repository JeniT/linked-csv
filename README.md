# Linked CSV

Many open data sets are essentially tables, or sets of tables, which follow the same regular structure. Linked CSV is a set of conventions for CSV files that enable them to be linked together and to be interpreted as JSON, XML or RDF.

This repository contains the (work in progress) spec for linked CSV.
